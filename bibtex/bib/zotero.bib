Participants included 22 postsecondary students with self-reported ADHD and 50 postsecondary student controls. Students took notes on a lecture, reviewed them, and took a written recall test. The independent variables were disability status, sustained attention, handwriting speed, verbal working memory, and listening comprehension. The dependent variables were quality of notes and written recall. Students with ADHD obtained lower scores on written recall and handwriting speed compared to controls, but did not differ on quality of notes, sustained attention, verbal working memory, or listening comprehension. Sustained attention and listening comprehension predicted quality of notes, and disability status, quality of notes, and listening comprehension predicted written recall.},

In a high-profile investigation comparing note-taking writing on paper versus typing on a laptop keyboard, Mueller and Oppenheimer (Psychological Science, 25, 1159\textendash{}1168, 2014) concluded that taking notes by longhand is superior. We conducted a direct replication of Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) and extended their work by including groups who took notes using eWriters and who did not take notes. Some trends suggested longhand superiority; however, performance did not consistently differ between any groups (experiments 1 and 2), including a group who did not take notes (experiment 2). Group differences were further decreased after students studied their notes (experiment 2). A meta-analysis (combining direct replications) of test performance revealed small (nonsignificant) effects favoring longhand. Based on the present outcomes and other available evidence, concluding which method is superior for improving the functions of note-taking seems premature.},

  abstract = {Notetaking and review are positively related to academic achievement, but many students record too few notes to benefit fully from these activities. This paper presents ten factors that may constrain notetaking and review, and provides corresponding implications for improving these study behaviors and for conducting further research. Some instructional implications are that students should record more extensive and conceptual notes and that instructors can help students by organizing their presentations, reducing lecture rate, pausing for notetaking, emphasizing key ideas and encouraging alternate frameworks for notetaking and review. Instructors can also facilitate learning by providing learners with notes for review and with knowledge about testing. In addition, instructors should consider the cognitive processing differences among students because certain learners are likely to find notetaking dysfunctional relative to other means of acquisition. The implications for research focus on determining the optimal notetaking and review activities.},

Prior studies have primarily focused on students' capacity for multitasking and distraction when using laptops. The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers' tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.},

The authors offer instructors a menu of research-based advice for bolstering student note taking: provide complete notes, provide partial notes, provide notetaking cues, re-present the lesson, provide pauses and revision opportunities, control laptop usage, control ``cyber slacking,'' use PowerPoint slides effectively, and teach note-taking skills.

                    Impossible Persons, Daniel Harbour's comprehensive and groundbreaking formal theory of grammatical person, upends understanding of a~universal and ubiquitous~grammatical category. Breaking with much past work, Harbour establishes three core theses, one empirical, one theoretical, and one metatheoretical. Together, these redefine the data subsumed under the rubric of ``person,'' simplify the feature inventory that a theory of person must posit, and restructure the metatheory in which feature theory as a whole resides.At its~heart, Impossible Persons~poses~a simple question of the possible versus the actual: in how many ways could languages configure their person systems, in how many do they configure them, and what explains the size and shape of the shortfall? Harbour's empirical thesis\textemdash{}that the primary object of study for persons are partitions, not syncretisms\textemdash{}transforms a sea of data into a categorical problem of the attested and the absent. Positing, innovatively, that features denote actions, not predicates, he shows that~two features alone~generate all and only the attested systems. This~apparently poor~inventory yields rich explanatory dividends, covering the morphological composition of person, its interaction with number, its connection to space, and properties of its semantics and linearization. Moreover, the core properties of this approach are shared with Harbour's earlier work on number features. Jointly, these results establish an important metatheoretical corollary~concerning the balance between~richness~of~feature semantics~and restrictiveness of~feature inventories.~This corollary holds deep implications for how linguists should approach feature theory in future.},

The semantic analysis of comparatives is built on top of a more general analysis of gradable predicates, which makes crucial uses of abstract representations of measurement (scales), formalized as sets of objects (degrees) ordered with respect to some dimension (size, speed, brightness, etc.). The interaction of the basic semantics of gradability with the combinatorics of clausal syntax permits the expression of an unlimited number of arbitrarily complex comparisons, and leads to interactions between comparatives and other logical expressions in a sentence.},

I then discuss linguistic aspects of individuation and the count/mass distinction in more detail. I distinguish between the grammatical systems of languages and the lexical properties of nouns, focusing on crosslinguistic variation. Languages vary substantially in the grammatical conditions that quantity expressions impose on the nouns they combine with, as well as in the exact lexical and grammatical properties of nouns.

Abstract

We propose an interpretation of the vision process and a structural analysis of nouns and nominal reference which make it possible to relate the visual/cognitive and the linguistic encapsulation of objecthood in a rigorous way. The result of this integrated hypothesis is a predictive account of possible and impossible nouns lexicalizing visual objects. Visual objects are indexed relations between stimuli interpreted via visual properties, such as [round], and what we define as object concepts: a red ball is the relation between the red and spherical features and the object concept of a ball. In language, nouns identify object concepts, semantically modelled as kinds, and the noun phrases they head can refer to instances of those kinds. No aspect of grammatical structure links up to visual properties directly, so no noun in natural language can denote an arbitrary subset of visual properties; the interaction is only at the level of objects, whether an abstract concept or a fully specified referent (the latter expressed by a full noun phrase). We formalize the relation between the two by means of an infomorphism, a formal representation of information flow between systems. This translates the objects of the visual and linguistic systems in terms of information types and tokens, constraining the possible lexicalization of object concepts. For instance, a visual property cannot be identified by a choice of noun unless it is interpreted as instantiating an object concept, because nouns can denote object concepts but not directly properties.},

Focusing on Arabic, where the plural comes in many guises, and proposing different syntactic positions for its different manifestations, I show that, while classifying plurals (broken and sound plurals) allow an inclusive reading ( one or more ), counting plurals (plural of the singulative and double plurals) do not: they tolerate only exclusive readings ( more than one ). I then show that classifying plurals in Arabic allow inclusive readings in environments that favour number neutrality (modals, negation, etc.) and argue that, in these contexts, plurals denote kinds (in the sense of Carlson 1977 and following Grimm 2013 for English plurals). Such plural nominals do not presuppose the existence of any particular referents: they are weakly referential and that is why they allow inclusive readings.},

  title = {Hindi Pseudo-Incorporation},
  volume = {29},
  issn = {1573-0859},
  abstract = {This paper argues that Hindi incorporation is, in fact, pseudo-incorporation, involving noun phrases rather than nouns. Furthermore, it shows that there is no requirement that the incorporated nominal surface as a morphological or even a syntactic unit with the verb. Such loosely aligned nominals can nevertheless be identified as incorporation on the basis of semantic intuitions having to do with number interpretation, anaphora, and certain properties typically associated with lexical processes. Contrary to standard assumptions, it is argued that the target of pseudo-incorporation is specified for number. Singular incorporated nominals in Hindi are shown to be semantically singular, with number neutrality arising as a consequence of interaction with aspectual operators. Taking aspectual information into account is also shown to have interesting implications for current approaches to the semantics of incorporation, one in which the incorporated nominal introduces a discourse referent, and one in which it functions as a predicate modifier. A closer look at the effect of aspect on anaphora, for example, does not unequivocally support the predicate modification view of pseudo-incorporation. The paper draws on data from Hungarian, and to some extent Danish, to explore the cross-linguistic applicability of the claims made on the basis of Hindi. Most notably, a distinction between Hungarian verbs with respect to incorporation of bare singulars provides striking confirmation of the claim that number morphology is semantically visible in pseudo-incorporation. It also addresses restrictions on the productivity of pseudo-incorporation in light of the proposed analysis of pseudo-incorporation.},

I argue that this pattern is not due to DOM objects and indirect objects being represented identically in syntax, but due to syncretism between accusative and dative case in these languages. This is indicated by a number of syntactic tests which group DOM objects with morphologically zero-coded direct objects, rather than with indirect objects, including nominalisation, relativisation, controlling secondary predicates, and passivisation. I suggest that languages with a ditransitive alternation between direct/indirect and primary/secondary objects provide further support for the syntactic difference of DOM and dative objects.},

These theories raise questions for sentence comprehension: how are cues to these disparate components recognized and put back together to construct a complete and coherent representation of the event under discussion? Such questions are made all the more complex during real-time processing as these components arrive one after another in quick succession, and yet studies show that speakers are highly sensitive to these cues and use them to guide interpretation in a rapid and highly incremental fashion. The chapter examines studies from the psycholinguistic literature with a focus on three aspects of event structure: manner and result verbal meanings, temporal boundaries of events, and the encoding of event participants.},

As generics are encoded in various forms that also have other meanings, and differ across languages, children need to learn which morphosyntactic markers are compatible with generic interpretations. The evidence suggests that children do not need to actively learn generic meanings, but rather, they need to learn to restrict generic interpretations to specific forms of the target grammar. In spontaneous speech children use generic expressions appropriately, early and robustly. In comprehension, while initially overgeneralizing generic interpretations beyond target forms, children also demonstrate that they can exploit the complex relationships between sentence structure and generic meanings; and can integrate the relevant pragmatic and grammatical cues in understanding generic expressions.},

The article concentrates on the relation between syntax and morphology, and more specifically, on the question of whether there is a generative system for word formation separate from syntax. The arguments for a distinct word-syntax module are described. These arguments provide a solid case for the hypothesis that the systems which generate the syntax of words and the syntax of phrases must be separated. The general conclusion is that there are no direct interactions between word syntax and phrasal syntax. They interact only indirectly, via the process of insertion that connects structures from both submodules, and via the rules which connect morphosyntactic structures with morphophonological ones.},

In this chapter, it is argued that phrases that are `attributive', as distinct from `referential', in Donnellan's 1966 sense are `referential' in the Givenness Hierarchy sense, and are marked as such in languages that mark referentiality overtly via determiners or case marking. Furthermore, it is suggested that bare nominal phrases in languages that allow them are unspecified for referentiality, but that an implicature of non-referentiality for a bare nominal may be generated in languages that mark definiteness or referentiality morphologically.},

  volume = {3},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the semantics and pragmatics of singular and plural nominals in languages that manifest a binary morphological number distinction within this category. We review the main challenges such an account has to meet, and develop an analysis which treats the plural morpheme as semantically relevant, and the singular form as not contributing any number restriction on its own but acquiring one when in competition with the plural form. The competition between singular and plural nominals is grounded in bidirectional optimization over form-meaning pairs. The main conceptual advantage our proposal has over recent alternative accounts is that it respects Horn's `division of pragmatic labor', in that it treats morphologically marked forms as semantically marked, and morphologically unmarked forms as semantically unmarked. In our account, plural forms are polysemous between an exclusive plural sense, which enforces sum reference, and an inclusive sense, which allows both atoms and sums as possible witnesses. The analysis predicts that a plural form is pragmatically appropriate only in case sum values are among the intended referents. To account for the choice between these two senses in context we invoke the Strongest Meaning Hypothesis, an independently motivated pragmatic principle. Finally, we show how the approach we develop explains some puzzling contrasts in number marking between English three/more children and Hungarian h{\'a}rom/t{\"o}bb gyerek (`three/more child'), a problem that has not been properly accounted for in the literature so far.},

However, much learning is rapid and does not depend on temporal contiguity, which has never been precisely defined. These points are well illustrated by studies showing that the temporal relations between events are rapidly learned- even over long delays- and that this knowledge governs the form and timing of behavior. The speed with which anticipatory responses emerge in conditioning paradigms is determined by the information that cues provide about the timing of rewards. The challenge for understanding the neurobiology of learning is to understand the mechanisms in the nervous system that encode information from even a single experience, the nature of the memory mechanisms that can encode quantities such as time, and how the brain can flexibly perform computations based on this information.},

  abstract = {Abstract: This chapter provides an overview of noun incorporation in broad terms, examining nominals found either within or strictly adjacent to predicates from numerous languages. Syntactic issues have shifted from an earlier debate about whether noun incorporation was an operation in the lexicon or syntax to more recent discussion about whether noun incorporation is a narrow syntax or PF operation. Other issues concern whether phrases or just heads can incorporate. If phrases incorporate, are they phrasal at the point of incorporation? AGREE analyses examine the trigger for incorporation. A number of analyses posit that there is no movement of the nominal at all (pseudo noun incorporation), and utilize an adjacency relation between the verb and incorporated nominal. It remains clear that languages show similar cross-linguistic properties in noun incorporation, even to the extent that language-internal differences are often similar, often relating to verb class. The expansion of the set of empirical data from semantic analyses and other work continues to lead toward refinements.},

  abstract = {Noun-incorporation structures (e.g. Mithun, 1984, Baker, 1988) have been investigated in detail by semanticists in recent years. Much of this work has centered around a notion of ``semantic incorporation'' (van Geenhoven, 1998), the semantic correlate of incorporation structures. A theory of semantic incorporation is necessary to account for a consistent constellation of semantic effects associated with noun-incorporation, including indefiniteness, lack of specificity, lack of scoping interactions with other logical operators, etc. In this paper I argue that this same constellation of effects is found in some (morphologically) unincorporated structures, and propose that a further notion, that of restrictedness, also appears to be a consistent, stable feature of all these structures, and bears further investigation.},

It is shown that the head-movement approach captures important facts about noun incorporation in the Mapudungun language that the other theories so far leave unexplained. I conclude that the device of head-movement is still needed in generative theory, despite conceptual concerns about this type of movement raised by some minimalist theorists.},

  abstract = {ON THE NATURE OF NOUN INCORPORATION Marianne Mithun State University of New York, Albany It has been suggested by Sadock 1986 that certain constructions in Greenlandic Eskimo and Southern Tiwa provide evidence against proposals of Mithun 1984 concerning the nature of noun incorporation. These objections are discussed, along with issues concerning the discourse salience, reference, and semantic interpretation of incorporated nouns. Sadock 1986 has devoted considerable effort to demonstrating that denominal verb formation in Greenlandic Eskimo shares none ofthe semantic or pragmatic functions of noun incorporation as generally understood. This is an important conclusion, although not completely astonishing: denominal verb formation is a different formal process. In N[oun] Incorporation], as commonly understood since Sapir 191 1 , a noun stem is compounded with a verb stem to yield a more specific, derived verb stem. The Greenlandic construction is based on a single noun stem with a derivational suffix. It is not entirely clear why one would refer to this as NI, since it is not obvious what such nouns are incorporated into. In incorporating languages, a verb minus its Incorporated] N[oun] is still a well-formed verb; but in Greenlandic, a denominal verb minus its noun stem would be no word at all.1 1 A number of authors used the term 'noun incorporation' in the standard sense before Sapir. However, Sapir was quite explicit in delimiting the scope of the term: 'It is this process of compounding a noun stem with a verb that it is here proposed to call noun incorporation' (1911:257). It is not the case that he simply failed to consider Eskimo, since he described the denominal verb construction at length (254): 'Many American languages form denominative verbs from noun stems by means of various derivative affixes of verbal, generally transitive meaning ... It can hardly be maintained, however , that verbs of this type have had much to do with a belief in the existence of noun incorporation, the process that they illustrate being a familiar one in Indo-Germanic. Eskimo, a language particularly rich in suffixes that verbify nouns, has been termed polysynthetic, but has not been employed by serious students as a source of examples of noun incorporation.' He concluded his article with a caveat (281-2): 'Lest it be thought, however, that noun incorporation is indeed the characteristic ofAmerican languages generally, it is well to point out that it is entirely absent in a large, perhaps the larger, number of them. Such are Athabascan, Salish, Chinookan, Yokuts, Siouan, and Eskimo ; and yet Athabascan and Eskimo might well be considered types of "polysynthetic" languages.' More recently, in two insightful articles, Hag{\`e}ge 1978, 1980 has shown (among other things) that incorporation and the Salish derivational process involving 'lexical suffixes' are formally distinct in a number of ways. Particularly pertinent is the coexistence of both incorporated nouns and lexical suffixes in the Sliammon dialect of Mainland Comox. Hag{\`e}ge points out (1978:67) that the lexical suffixes are the relics of an older system: 'It is clear from the foregoing that the lexical suffixes constitute an archaic system which is characterized by its coherence and its autonomy with regard to the nouns whose meanings are related to theirs. This alone would suffice to show the difference between these suffixes and the incorporated nouns in languages such as N{\'a}huatl, Southern Paiute, Yana etc' 32 ON THE NATURE OF NOUN INCORPORATION33 Southern Tiwa, the other language cited by S, is a very different case: unlike Greenlandic, it does show canonical incorporation. S reports that, according to Allen et al. 1984, incorporation in Southern Tiwa is obligatory; so it cannot be a lexical process. In fact, as Allen et al. make clear, incorporation is a function of such features as animacy, humanness, and number. Apparently S has overlooked their concluding statement (310): 'Furthermore, overlay relations such as "new topic" may sometimes block incorporation where it is otherwise necessary.' It is observations of this kind that I addressed in Mithun 1984. Contrary to S's understanding, the purpose of my 1984 article is in fact not to prove 'the null hypothesis'\textemdash{}'that any individual word-building process does not interact with the syntax', and 'that NI is...},

  abstract = {This paper examines a phenomenon of Niuean (Oceanic) often called Noun Incorporation(NI). It is shown that, since the nominalelement in these constructions is a phrase(NP) rather than a head (N0), this phenomenondoes not in fact constitute NI in the normalsense of the term. Instead, it is termedPseudo Noun Incorporation, or PNI. An analysisis presented in which an object NP (rather thanDP) is generated adjacent to a verb. Since NPcannot check absolutive case, it fails to moveout of VP, hence it undergoes predicate frontingalong with the verb to derive the `incorporated' order V-O-PARTICLES-S-X: the normal order isV-PARTICLES-S-O-X. The properties of threesubtypes of PNI are examined in some detail:general PNI, existential PNI, and instrumentalPNI, and the analysis is developed to accountfor their properties. General PNI involves thegeneration of an NP object, in which thereferential position remains open, resultingin a habitual reading for the sentence.Instrumental PNI is similar, except it doesnot have the same aspectual consequences.In existential PNI, on the other hand, anexistential verb (fai `have/be', muhu `haveplenty/be plentiful') binds the positionin NP, thus allowing the NP to be referentialand to be modified by a relative clause.Existential PNI thus results from a hybridV/DET category (such as fai) whichsimultaneously binds the open position in NP and acts asthe head predicate of the sentence. Wesee that the properties of Niuean PNI donot fit into the various typologies of NIavailable in the literature, hence a novelanalysis is required, such as the one proposed in this paper.},
